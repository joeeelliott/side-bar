# Side-bar Project

Key concepts covered:

* mouseover / mouseout in CSS
* sidebar using transform: translate to set position
* responsive sidebar using keyframes called in functions, which are then called in eventListener callback functions
* classList.toggle(), but not in it's most efficient form
* closeButton also accessing the toggle method of a different element
